chapter{Generative and Performative Algorithms}

\section{Introduction}

Today we find that two main paradigms of algorithmic design are clearly dominant; generative design and performative design. Generative design is the essential \emph{rule-based} algorithmic form of digital architecture. It is governed by repitive patterns, equations and shape transformations.  Performative design on the other hand, is optimizational; modifing and reshaping to adapt to a certain simulated environment.
