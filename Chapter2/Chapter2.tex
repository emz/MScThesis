\section{Computation and Computerization}

Today, in almost all engineering and architectural fields, computers are used heavily and almost
exclusively for any type of work. Some of the utilizations of computers in architecture such as 3D
NURBS or Mesh modelling programs, or any mouse manipulated 3D forms programmes, are often thought to
be computational. Although they essentially use numerical computation to display or 'translate'
\cite{terzidis06} different forms, ultimately it is the user who willingly manipulates the models.
This is a confusion between computation and computerization. 

\paragraph{Computerization}could be defined as using the computer as a tool instead of traditional
tools or media. One could use ink and paper to write a letter, or use a word processor instead. The
presentation is probably better, the work is done faster, but the content would not change on
account of this tool swap. The same notion basically applies to CAD programmes, which are merely
tools to draw shapes in a manner which essentially replaces pencil and paper, because ultimately the
user is in complete control.

\paragraph{Computation}on the other hand produces that which was not entirely planned out by the
user, it creates unpredicted results. The input in this case is not the final product. This input constraints
the process towards a roughly imagined product; but does not completely define it. This is due to the
fact that computation is used in areas where humans are very limited; such as calculation and
processing of large numbers. The same applies to architectural modelling; one could use computation
to enter a formula that would render a cube, but that is never the case. Computation is utilized in
producing objects of high complexity, or in large numbers with a wide spectrum of variation that
would make it impossible for the user to manually model.

To reiterate the above stated; the product of computation --- even though the algorithms that govern
it and the input it needs are designed by the human mind --- is not solely a product of the human mind, but a product of
a parallel logic.
